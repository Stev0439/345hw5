Reflection
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project. 

Design

What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

The most helpful thing about thinking about deisgn methods of the project was that it gave a direction and path for the bot before any piece of code was started. The design methods help create a path to follow to completing the bot, and gave a lot of insight to the team as to what we should do and how we should create the bot.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of the design process was creating the architecture design, as it had to encompass all of the different required parts of the project, and was used as a guide to implement the project. We took extra time working out details to give use a better idea of the project ahead of us, but it was the most challenging part. If we would have done something differently, I would say we should have worked on the archetecture design first before the other designs. When we were designing the project, we were following the order of required designs, leaving architecture to be done last. This required us to go back and re-adjust our design methods to fit the new architecture.

What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Some design methods I want to try again in the future on another project are the storyboard and our state transition mockup. The storyboard kinda helped us see how the bot would be used and give us a better understanding of the use of the bot. The state transition mockup helped more with the implementation of the bot, as it served as a guide on how specific functions should work. These design processes helped a lot with this bot project and would give them another shot in future projects.

Implementation

What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The most helpful thing with implementing, testing, and integrating the bot project was the use of git and github. As a team, we were able to work on our own branches and implement the changes into github as we finished up different features. Using git, we were able to easily move the changes in the orgin master branch to our local drive where the bot was set to read from and see the changes on the bot within seconds.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult thing about our implementation was simply meeting together as an entire group to finalize certain aspects of features we were implementing. We were able to work on our individually assigned tasks with the kanban board, but certain finalizations had to come in meetings in which we were short on due to our time conflicts, resulting in group chat messaging and a reliance on the project board. If we could have done something differently, we should of planned meetings in advanced and more often, this would allows us to be on the same page and work more efficiently on the bot project.

What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Overall

Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
