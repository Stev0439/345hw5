Reflection

Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project. 

Design

What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

The most helpful thing about thinking about deisgn methods of the project was that it gave a direction and path for the bot before any piece of code was started. The design methods help create a path to follow to completing the bot, and gave a lot of insight to the team as to what we should do and how we should create the bot.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of the design process was creating the architecture design, as it had to encompass all of the different required parts of the project, and was used as a guide to implement the project. We took extra time working out details to give use a better idea of the project ahead of us, but it was the most challenging part. If we would have done something differently, I would say we should have worked on the archetecture design first before the other designs. When we were designing the project, we were following the order of required designs, leaving architecture to be done last. This required us to go back and re-adjust our design methods to fit the new architecture.

What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Some design methods I want to try again in the future on another project are the storyboard and our state transition mockup. The storyboard kinda helped us see how the bot would be used and give us a better understanding of the use of the bot. The state transition mockup helped more with the implementation of the bot, as it served as a guide on how specific functions should work. These design processes helped a lot with this bot project and would give them another shot in future projects.

Implementation

What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The most helpful thing with implementing, testing, and integrating the bot project was the use of git and github. As a team, we were able to work on our own branches and implement the changes into github as we finished up different features. Using git, we were able to easily move the changes in the orgin master branch to our local drive where the bot was set to read from and see the changes on the bot within seconds.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult thing about our implementation was simply meeting together as an entire group to finalize certain aspects of features we were implementing. We were able to work on our individually assigned tasks with the kanban board, but certain finalizations had to come in meetings in which we were short on due to our time conflicts, resulting in group chat messaging and a reliance on the project board. If we could have done something differently, we should of planned meetings in advanced and more often, this would allows us to be on the same page and work more efficiently on the bot project.

What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Specific methods I would want to try again in the future on another project is the use of github integration into the project as well as desinged sprints. I believe that the sprints are a good way to keep on track and get certain features and progress accomplished in reasonable time. The use of github made testing and integrating the project super easy for the project and would look forwards to using it again in another project.

Process

What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

The most helpful thing about implementing kanban and code reviews into the project was that it allowed for the team to continuously work on the project when we were seperated. Due to scheduling conflicts, kanban allows for us to stay on track and finish up features and requirements that we set out to accomplish.

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult thing about the process was being able to work together as a team, being that we are all on the same page. The project felt like the three of us were working as three individuals and trying to integrate our individual work on the same project rather than a team working on a project together. I feel that this was due to the lack of meeting communication, as there was ample communication through messaging and the use of kanban. While this was not by fault of anyone in the team, we simply had scheduling conflicts between our three distinct schedules, limiting the amount of meetings we had together. I would prefer to meet with the team more often and to more work together as a team rather than seperate and trying to integrate it together, if possible. There may not always be time to meet with teammates and this projects proves that the use of certain methods can help one htrough it, but it would be nice to have been more connected.

What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would like to try to use kanban again on future projects, as it was a staple in this project on keeping everyone on track and the project organized. I would also like to have review meetings on future projects, as I feel it allows everyone to get a feel for where the project is at and what needs to be improved from there on out.

Overall

Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
